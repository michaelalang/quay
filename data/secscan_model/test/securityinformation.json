Attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user. \n            STATEMENT: In a containerized environment running SELinux in enforcing mode, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to escape the boundary of a container. In this case no additional access is gained, there is an additional (but more complicated step) to look at files the user already has access to.\n\nThe upstream project (Curl) also rated this CVE as Low, see link in External References.\n\nIt is unlikely that Red Hat offerings are utilizing the SFTP feature of Curl, so the opportunity to exploit it may not exist.

              "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in ipa/session/login_password in all supported versions of IPA. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. \n            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed. The moderate classification suggests that, while serious, the limitations on exploitation conditions and potential impact contribute to a moderate overall severity.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",

The most likely threat is from a local user, which may be possible depending on the configuration of the service and the format of parameters that it expects.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.\n\nThe maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.\n\nMoreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

              "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.\n\nThe maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.\n\nMoreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

(This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\" \n            STATEMENT: As per upstream this flaw cannot be exploited under normal documented use of the LZ4 library API. Also this flaw is only present in the lz4 library and the application binaries shipped with this application are not affected by it. \n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform 10 packages an older version of lz4 that has the flawed code. However, because OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated lz4 version since RHEL7.5 started to include it, Red Hat is not currently updating the OpenStack lz4 package.",
